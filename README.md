### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on gamified Bitcoin learning
- 🌱 I’m trying to grow in Wasm, JS Engine knowledge, and Rust.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything Bitcoin <-> Web related and anything else that sparks joy
- 💬 Ask me about my doggo 🐶
- 📫 Reach me on Twitter [@dunxen](https://twitter.com/dunxen)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I majored in physics, minored in pure maths, and played guitar for around 6 years. Expect rustiness in all of those, though.
